# WeightLossApp

For this application the user needs were that they needed an application that could keep track of their weight until they met their weightloss goals. To do this I would create a simple login screen, with prompts to sign the user up. Then we would collect their current weight, goal weight. Then after that we could collect their daily weight and use that information to create a line graph so that the user could easily visualize their weighloss. 

Coding for this application is a bit new for me, not because of the Java but because of the XML and how that plays into the blueprint. I'm excited to get into Android Studio more and understand how they all play together. For now I just was going off of the android website and random tutorials that I could find. 

One of the coolest parts of Android Studio is the Emulator. This is an amazing way to test your code and using it I found out all kinds of errors, from my variables not being constrained to redundant code ect. 

The most interesting thing about Android Studio is how all the different components come together, for example the blueprint, xml, and java code all work together to produce the application. This for me is so interesting. This means if you're stuck on a part and don't know the code off the top of your head, you might not need to, you can just use the design features in the Studio and just drag and drop features where you want them. 

Overall I wish I had more time to learn, with two kids this semester was a rough one and I'm hoping to hit the ground running next semester.
